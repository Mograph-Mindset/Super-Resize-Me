//-------------------------------------------------------------------

Scale all compositions by a specific ratio (2x, 0.5x, etc.) or set a target Comp Width or Comp Height and let the script do the math. Scale a top-level composition and all the child precomps and layers will scale relative to it.

The "Recursive" setting will scale all child precomps relative to your starting comp.

To run, go to Window > Super Resize Me!
